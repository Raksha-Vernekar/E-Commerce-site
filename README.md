# E-Commerce-site

This is not a website for online purchase. I have applied the knowledge that I have gained in Data Structures to build a model that mimics a website.

Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers.
